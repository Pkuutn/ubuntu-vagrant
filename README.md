This builds an up-to-date Vagrant Ubuntu Base Box as described at the [From Iso To Vagrant Box](http://blog.ruilopes.com/from-iso-to-vagrant-box.html) article.

Currently this targets [Ubuntu 16.04](https://help.ubuntu.com/16.04/installation-guide/amd64/index.html).

Just type `make` and follow the instructions.
